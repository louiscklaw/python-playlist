Key principles of good programming:

Modularization: Breaking down a software system into smaller, reusable modules.
Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and exposing a clean, abstract interface.
Encapsulation: Protecting data and behavior within a module.
Reusability: Designing code that can be easily reused in other parts of the system.
Maintainability: Making it easy to read, understand, and modify code.
Clarity: Writing clear and concise code that is easy to understand.
Documentation: Providing comprehensive documentation to explain the code and its purpose.
Testing: Writing tests to ensure that code meets its requirements.
