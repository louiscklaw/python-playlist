Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the position of Associate Director, Data Analytics at Manulife (International) Limited.

These roles have provided me with extensive knowledge in data analytics, software development, and project management.

In my previous positions, I successfully delivered impactful data-driven solutions end-to-end. I have a proven track record of uncovering insights and providing actionable recommendations to stakeholders. My technical skills include proficiency in SQL, Oracle, Python programming, and various data analytics visualization tools such as PowerBI. Additionally, I am familiar with cloud platforms like Azure and have hands-on experience in building generalized linear models and deep learning models.

What sets me apart is my ability to effectively communicate complex data findings to non-technical audiences. I excel at presenting analytical insights through interactive dashboards and presentations. Moreover, my strong problem-solving skills, proactive attitude, and ability to manage multiple priorities make me an asset in fast-paced environments.

Outside of work, I am passionate about R&D projects and continuously enhancing my skills. In my free time, I engage in software development using technologies like React and GatsbyJS. Additionally, I explore hardware/electronic projects using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. My GitHub page showcases some of my personal projects: [GitHub Page](https://louiscklaw.github.io).
