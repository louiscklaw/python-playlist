Subject: Job Application for Data Engineer Position at Admazes Limited

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Engineer position at Admazes Limited, as advertised on JobsDB. With my strong background in data analysis and engineering, I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team.

I have a degree in Computer Science and over 10 years of experience working with large-scale data sets and complex data models. My expertise includes performing analyses using scoring and predictive models, implementing data exploration techniques, creating visualizations with Scala, Python, and SQL, and developing ETL systems for data compilation. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and have a high curiosity for data discovery.

In my previous roles at telecom and software companies such as China Mobile Hong Kong, SierraWireless, and Tinklabs, I have successfully led projects utilizing Agile/Scrum methodologies. I have also demonstrated strong communication skills by effectively conveying complex findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Apart from my professional experience, I am passionate about R&D projects and constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge in software development (React, GatsbyJS, PHP), hardware/electronics (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), PCB layout design, web scraping, and GitHub collaboration.

As a daily Linux user with proficiency in web frontend frameworks (React, Next.js, Gatsby) and databases (MySQL/MariaDB, Firebase), I bring a comprehensive skill set that aligns well with the requirements of the Data Engineer role at Admazes Limited.

Please find more information about me on my GitHub page: [https://louiscklaw.github.io](https://louiscklaw.github.io). 

I am excited about the possibility of joining Admazes Limited and contributing to its success. Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit your organization.
